# About RubyData

RubyData aims to increase two populations of:

1. Developers who write opensource data tools for Rubyists.
2. Users who use opensource data tools with their products written in Ruby.

For such developers and users, RubyData wants to provide the following things:

- Environments to try the tools
- Documents to learn the tools and related topics
- Places to collaborate with each other

Moreover, RubyData wants to make borderless world between other language communities,
so we wants to cooperate with other organizations such as PyData.
